  <div class=intro>
    <p>
      FunctionalJS is a meetup that discusses functional programming with Javascript - whether that means underscore/lodash, reinventing a broken version of curry for the nth time, or languages that compile to JS to bring more functional tools to bear.

    <p>Our events are all recorded in <a href=http://lanyrd.com/series/funjsldn/>this series</a> on Lanyrd - find tickets etc there.</p>
